# Regime change detection on ESP32

-  Using the devcontainer is advised
-  Just use the idf-esp Build for the usual ESP32 MCU
-  PVS code analysis should work, if not, try to reconfigure using the CMake extension
-  If you want to check for problems with clang, you need to install the esp-clang tool and reconfigure the CMakeLists.txt and c_cpp_properties.json
